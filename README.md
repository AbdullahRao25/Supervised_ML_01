# Diabetes Prediction Model

This repository contains a machine learning model for predicting diabetes based on the Pima Indians Diabetes Database. The model utilizes the following features from the dataset:

- **Pregnancies**
- **Glucose**
- **Blood Pressure**
- **Skin Thickness**
- **Insulin**
- **BMI**
- **Diabetes Pedigree Function**
- **Age**

The goal of this project is to predict whether a person has diabetes based on these features.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values and scaling features for model improvement.
- **Modeling**: A machine learning model (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, etc.) is used to predict diabetes.
- **Evaluation**: Model performance is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is the **Pima Indians Diabetes Database** which can be found at:

### Data Description

- **Pregnancies**: Number of times pregnant
- **Glucose**: Plasma glucose concentration
- **Blood Pressure**: Diastolic blood pressure
- **Skin Thickness**: Triceps skinfold thickness
- **Insulin**: 2-Hour serum insulin
- **BMI**: Body mass index
- **Diabetes Pedigree Function**: A function that scores the likelihood of diabetes based on family history
- **Age**: Age in years
- **Outcome**: Class variable indicating if the person has diabetes (1) or not (0)
